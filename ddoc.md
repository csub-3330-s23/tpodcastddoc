## Project Summary
#### The Aux Cord is a Twitch Livestream Podcast that is fun and inviting for everyone. Set to stream for about two hours per week on Wednesdays, topics regarding music, different music artists, and pop culture in general will be discussed. The audience can interact, comment, and pitch discussion topics for the host and guest to talk about. The podcast will also include fun segments and games to encourage interaction between viewers and the host. 

## Interactive Design Summary
#### The livestream viewers will be able to interact with the host through comments on the livestream. The host can view the comments and respond to them directly on the podcast and even choose them as topic discussion ideas if they include it. There will be opportunities like questions, segments, and games where viewers and hosts can interact through comments and direct comment response.

## User Experience
### The project will operate off of the following user stories:
#### As a user, I want to watch someone talk about music for 2 hours.
#### As a user, I want to watch someone talk about pop culture for 2 hours.
#### As a user, I want to comment at least once on the stream.
#### As a user, I want someone to interact with my comment at least once on the stream.
#### As a user, I want to see at least one graphic on the screen.
#### As a user, I want to get one music recommendation every time I watch.
#### As a user, I want to see someone different on the stream every other week.
#### As a user, I want at least one pop culture topic to be discussed per stream.

## Narrative Design
#### For each episode of the podcast, there will be a theme and a playlist for that theme. The main part of the podcast will consist of discussing the songs on that playlist and how the artists, the theme, or the art itself makes us feel. This can be a segway into telling personal stories that the viewers can relate to and comment on. This will also be an opportunity for things to be simply commical and fun. 
#### After the discussion of the playlist, then a pop culture topic will be discussed. Again another opportunity for fun interaction with the views, opinions and entertaining discussion. 


## Technical Design
#### There will only be one camera for the livestream and all participating members of the podcast will be visible in frame. There will be two microphones and one sound board to control audio volume, sound, and sound effects. StreamLabs OBS will be used as the necessary software for live streaming and recording. Photoshop will be used for necessary overlays. There will be lights coming from behind the camera to create a bright effect in frame and to minimize any dark shadows coming from the other natural light in the room.
